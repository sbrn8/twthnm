Tutorial from Coding Garden on YouTube

- [x] created a web page that allows user to post 'tweets' using a framework
- [x] JavaScript to listen to the form, get user input
- [x] set up a server with npm, express, and morgan
- [x] get and post route (can log out req.body as an empty obj)

* [x] data validation (must be a string and not empty, ouput error 422 and error message if not valid, 422 error code)
* [ ] Database using MongoDB

## Things that I have to figure out

- I was stuck at the GET and POST part with receiving the data as an object in the terminal. Turns out it was the API_URL caused the error code.
